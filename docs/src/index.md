# CurrencyBaskets.jl

This package provides a simple interface to using a wide variety of currencies
with checked arithmetic in Julia. While floating point arithmetic is very
convenient for currency computations, there are common problems with using
floating point comparisons. This package addresses those issues by treating
monetary amounts as fixed-point decimals.
